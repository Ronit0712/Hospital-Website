KEM Hospital is run by the KEM Hospital Society, a registered charitable trust.<br><br>

                What began with 4 maternity beds, is now a 550+ bedded multi-specialty tertiary level teaching institution. Much of the growth was spearheaded by the dynamic and visionary Dr. Banoo Coyaji, who was appointed as the Chief Medical Officer in 1944 and was awarded the Padma Bhushan and Magsaysay Awards. The hospital is particularly known for some of its Centres of Excellence many of which were the first of their kind in Pune and the surrounding region. These include Critical Care, Diabetology, Nephrology and Dialysis, High Risk Obstetrics, Neonatology and a Comprehensive Rehabilitation Centre for children with special needs.
